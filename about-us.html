      <p>Our core values that underpin everything we do and that have enabled our success on the global stage, is the difference that makes the difference</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live life with passion – we passionately believe in what we do and thus each day, each training, each coaching session is an adventure to be experienced
          and to be excited by and to bring our best game every single time.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Deliver Excellence – We bring our best game to everything we do. Our goal is to WOW our clients and our students. For them to walk away transformed, empowered and happy EVERY SINGLE TIME.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Embrace Courage – nothing great has ever been achieved by staying in ones comfort zone. Life is an adventure to be embraced and explored. We dare to push the boundaries, to explore the unknown, which enables our students
            and clients to do the same. Achieving your dreams lies once you step beyond your comfort zone.</li>
          <li>Have Fun -  We love everything we do and have fun doing it. Life is meant to be enjoyed. When we give ourselves permission to express our own quirky uniqueness we connect into our innate greatness.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Take responsibility -  Taking responsibility is the cornerstone of success. We own our outcomes – the good, the bad and the indifferent. When we succeed, we celebrate, when we don’t we take stock, own the outcome and find
            another way to achieve desired outcome. The core value of all successful people is that the buck stops with us. Full ownership means we have the power to create what we desire.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Love & connection. -  one for all and all for one – we are a family. Your success is our success. Seeing the transformation taking place in the lives of our students and clients is the reward we seek.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Innovation -  we never settle with the status quo. We are always looking to see how we can improve, adapt and enhance everything we do to add even more value to the experience we offer in all our programs.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Insatiable curiosity -  even after over a decade, we are still a green and growing company. Our eyes are wide open as there is always so much more to learn and grow. We embrace the value of being lifelong learners.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Uniqueness – We believe in standing out and owning our own identity. Thinking outside the box and having the courage and to embrace being thought leaders and trend setters in a competitive environment.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Deliver on Results – And putting it together, we take responsibility for what we promise EVERY SINGLE TIME.</li>
